# 🌱 Beginner Guide: What EC, PPM, and pH Mean (Hydroponics)

If you’re new to hydroponics, don’t worry — these numbers sound way more complicated than they are.

Think of them as your **water health dashboard**.

---

# ✅ pH (Target: 5.8–6.2)

## What is pH?
pH tells you how **acidic or basic** your water is.

- Low pH = more acidic  
- High pH = more basic  

## Why it matters
Plants can only absorb nutrients when pH is in the right range.

- Too high → nutrients get “locked out”
- Too low → roots get stressed

## Best pH for towers
For lettuce, herbs, kale, strawberries:

🎯 **5.8–6.2 (aim for ~6.0)**

---

# ✅ EC (Target for seedlings: 0.4–0.8)

## What is EC?
EC = **Electrical Conductivity**

That’s a fancy way of saying:

> How much fertilizer/nutrients are dissolved in the water.

More nutrients = higher EC.

## EC scale (easy reference)

| EC Level | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| 0.0 | Plain water |
| 0.4–0.8 | Seedlings (gentle feed) |
| 1.2–1.6 | Full leafy growth |
| 1.8+ | Fruiting plants |

## Seedling range
🌱 **0.4–0.8 EC** = light feeding so baby roots don’t burn

---

# ✅ PPM (Target for seedlings: 200–400)

## What is PPM?
PPM = **Parts Per Million**

It’s basically the same idea as EC, just shown as a bigger number:

> How much nutrient “stuff” is in the water.

- EC is the strength scale
- PPM is the same strength, expressed differently

## Typical PPM ranges

| Plant Stage | PPM Range |
|------------|----------|
| Germination | 0–150 |
| Seedlings | 200–400 |
| Leafy greens | 650–900 |
| Fruiting (strawberries) | 900–1100 |

# ⚠️ What does “500-scale” mean?

Different meters convert EC → PPM differently.

- **500-scale** (common in the US)
- **700-scale** (common in Europe)

Example:

EC 1.0 =
- 500 ppm (500-scale meter)
- 700 ppm (700-scale meter)

## Beginner tip
📌 If your meter shows EC, use EC — it avoids confusion.

# 🌱 Simple Beginner Feeding Plan

## Stage 0: Germination (Days 0–7)

✅ Plain water only  
No nutrients needed yet

- EC: ~0.0–0.3  
- PPM: 0–150  

---

## Stage 1: First True Leaves (Days 7–14)

Start feeding at **¼ strength**

Mix per 1 gallon:

- FloraMicro: **1.25 mL**
- FloraGro: **1.25 mL**
- FloraBloom: **1.25 mL**

This gives roughly:

- EC: ~0.5  
- PPM: ~250  
- pH: ~6.0  

Perfect for seedlings.

# 🛠 Tools You Actually Need

Minimum beginner setup:

- pH meter or test drops
- EC/PPM meter (TDS meter)

That’s it.

---

# 🎯 Easy Mental Model

Think of nutrients like baby formula:

- Seeds = don’t need food yet  
- Seedlings = very diluted formula  
- Big leafy plants = normal strength  
- Fruiting plants = extra support  

EC/PPM tells you how strong the “formula” is  
pH tells you if plants can absorb it

## Optional Next Step
If you tell me your reservoir size (3 gal, 5 gal, 10 gal),
I can make an exact dosing chart so you never have to think about EC/PPM.
