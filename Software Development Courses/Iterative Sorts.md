## Bubble Sort

![[bubblesort.gif]]

- Iterative loop through an array and compare 2 indexes. 
- If 2 indexes are not out of order, do nothing and move to the next iteration
- If they are out of order, swap places
- Outer loop of function will check if anything swapped. If indexes were swap, start again.
