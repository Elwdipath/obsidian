## 🍳 Instructions
#### Step 1: Sear the salmon & steam rice

Start cooking your rice in a rice cooker or pot according to the package directions. 

For the salmon, take a thawed filet, remove the skin, and sprinkle all sides with salt. 

Add a little bit of oil to a hot pan and place it down to develop a nice sear. Add a tiny drizzle of oil to the uneven side and then flip over the salmon. 

- It’s hard to get an even sear on this side since it bellies out, but try adding weight or pressing the salmon with a spatula to develop a sear. 

Sear for about 7 minutes or until just cooked through and take it off the pan. Set aside to rest.

#### Step 2: Pickle the vegetables

Add julienned carrots to a glass jar along with some thinly sliced serrano peppers for heat.

Add salt and a tiny pinch of msg. Pour over the water and vinegar mixture, ensuring the sliced veggies are completely submerged and will pickleevenly.

- These will get more pickled over time and store well in the fridge for a long time.

#### Step 3: Assemble the box

To assemble the bento, place the re-heatable items in the bottom layer (if you have a two-layer bento box). First, put in the salmon, followed by 100 g of cooked rice in the center. Lastly, for additional protein, add 50 g of frozen edamame on the side with a sprinkle of salt.
